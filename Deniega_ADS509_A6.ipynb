The lowest sentiments for her are from When You Walk Away, Outrageous, and I Walk On Guilded Splinters. It is rather apparent that the song title and the lyrics highly correlate with each other. The resulting subject matter of optimistic romantic language drives positive sentiment scores such as from the words \"love\" and \"perfection\". Words that collapse toward death or painful themes tend to drive negative sentiment scores such as from \"away\", \"outrageous\", and \"splinters\"."

The three lowest song sentiments are from Love Kills, Criminal Intent, and Don't Fucking Tell Me What To Do. Similar to Cher's findings, positive words like \"love\" and \"indestructible\" influence the theme of words used in corresponding lyrics. On the negative side, the words \"kills\", \"criminal\" and \"fucking\" suggest more use of negative scoring words in the lyrics."

In other iterations, it may be useful to include emojis with a dictionary of words as there might not be enough significance using emojis alone. Otherwise, we may interpret sentiment of these two artists as neutral on emoji terms."
